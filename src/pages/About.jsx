              In 2022, I decided it was time for a career change. While I
              enjoyed working in marketing, I knew it wasn't where I was
              supposed to be.

              I had always been interested in software development. So, after
              getting a Bachelor's in Public Relations from Virginia Tech in
              2020, I went back to school to the University of Richmond for a
              Software Development Bootcamp.
              <strong> And I never looked back.</strong>
